## ⚡ What Is This?

UselessBot is a chaos-fueled language model that reacts with absurd intensity.

- Mad? It's **FURIOUS** 😤  
- Happy? It's **EUPHORIC** 🎉  
- Bored? It makes it sound **life-threatening** ⚰️  
- Sad? It's **emotionally devastated** 😭  

It will never solve your problems. It will only feel them loudly.
